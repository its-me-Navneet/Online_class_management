        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably at no previous moment in the world history have commerce
          and industry become so complex, extensive, and globally
          interrelated as they are today. India, which is going through a
          rapid growth in its manufacturing sector, is not unaffected by
          these changes. The modern manufacturing environment entails a
          large variety of cross-disciplinary activities including the
          Design and IT. Engineers consequently are being called upon to
          work within new environmental, economical and social constraints
          which are increasingly becoming a part of contemporary engineering
          practice. Obviously, these elements need to find their way into
          the engineering curricula. However, traditional engineering
          instructional formats isolate teaching and research into specific
          disciplines with un-integrated curricula and therefore the
          structure of our engineering curricula have hardly changed in
          accordance with the modern manufacturing needs. Such divisions in
          the existing higher education formats are found to act as barriers
          to learning, behavior, and performance.</p>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect of engineering education which needs to be
          considered is the basic nature of the IT profession. The IT driven
          market of today features a model of innovation which is quite
          different from the research models that most institutes are
          familiar with. The new market model for innovation emphasizes on
          fast concept, funds projects with venture capital, fosters
          innovation by rewarding entrepreneurs who specialize in
          transforming people's practices to become more productive with the
          help of new technology. In contrast, the conventional research
          model emphasizes on careful development of ideas and principles
          and achieves innovation only after ideas have gone through a long
          pipeline that distills out the best and brings them into practice
          over a period of 15-20 years. This dichotomy between the new
          market-driven model and the conventional idea-pipeline model poses
          another great challenge to educators of engineering.</p>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current engineering education system in India, though huge and
          diverse, is mainly based on the conventional idea of pipeline
          model. To integrate the knowledge of a given discipline with IT
          enabled design, prototyping as well as manufacturing
          considerations, a need therefore exists for developing a new
          academic programmes. Apart from laying an emphasis on IT, the new
          approach should also give emphasis on aesthetic, ergonomic and
          functional considerations of products. The academic programme
          should also be able to respond to industry driven adaptive
          management structure.<br /></p>
       
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With above requirements in mind, the Ministry of Human Resource
          Development (MHRD), Government of India, felt the need to set up a
          national institute devoted exclusively for Information Technology
          (IT), Design & Manufacturing (D & M). It was envisaged that such
          an academic institute would promote excellence in the desired
          areas of specialization and would facilitate and promote the
          competitive advantage of Indian products and manufacturing in
          global markets. Further, the new Institute would serve as an
          inter-disciplinary institution for education and research by
          keeping the concept of Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) in mind.
          The India Institute of Information Technology, Design &
          Manufacturing (IIITDM) Jabalpur was thus established in January
          2005. Strong industry interface and close cooperation with other
          academic and research institutions are the key features of this
          Institute.

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mission of the Institute is to create a multidisciplinary
          academic environment to prepare and train manpower of excellence
          for nurturing and promoting knowledge-based activities and
          innovations in design, fabrication and manufacturing of products
          by bringing together a collaborative and mutually stimulating mix
          of different fields of science, engineering and arts. In doing so
          the Institute shall identify current and future agendas for
          scholarship, share knowledge and discoveries with the world
          community and actively cultivate individuals with the desire and
          capability to contribute to society.

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In planning for its future as well as for conducting its ongoing
          activities, the Institute seeks to act in a manner that is guided
          by a deep-rooted sense of shared values and aspirations. Built
          upon such a foundation, the Institute:
          <ul style="margin-left: 60px;margin-right: 60px;">
            <li>Honours and rewards high performance in learning, teaching, scholarship, research and creative activities by encouraging intellectual curiosity and protecting the multiple expressions of academic freedom.</li>
            <li>Seeks to provide an environment conducive to imaginative innovation, experimentation and creativity by encouraging all members of the academic community to take intellectual and creative risks and to embrace changes that will enhance the fulfillment of the Instituteâ€™s mission.</li>
            <li>Aspires to build an environment of tolerance and reasoned debate without any gender-, cast-, religious- or regional- bias by affirming the worth and personal dignity of every member of the Institute community and contributing to a campus climate of civility.</li>
